# VolGallery

A gallery of volumetric images and objects.

## Disclaimer

For each geometrical object, I have tried to specify the associated
copyrights if applicable. For instance, the STL mesh file used to
generate the volumetric Stanford Bunny objects belong to Stanford
University  (see for instance
[Stanford Bunny](https://github.com/dcoeurjo/VolGallery/Stanford-Bunny/)). 

In case some references are wrong and should be adjusted, please do
not hesitate to send me an e-Mail.

If you use some of the volumetric objects, 


## Rasterizer

To generate the digital objects  from a STL mesh file, I have used the
[binvox](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~min/binvox/) rasterizer. Once
the boundary has been obtained, a simple interior filling process has
been used to fill up the objects.
