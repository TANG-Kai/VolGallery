## Disclaimer

For each geometrical object, I have tried to specify the associated
copyrights if applicable. For instance, the STL mesh file used to
generate the volumetric Stanford Bunny objects belong to Stanford
University  (see for instance
[Stanford Bunny](https://github.com/dcoeurjo/VolGallery/tree/master/Stanford-Bunny/)). 

In case some references are wrong and should be adjusted, please do
not hesitate to send me an e-Mail.

If you use digital objects from this repository, it would be great if
you could "star" this project on GitHub or notify me.


## Rasterizer

To generate the digital objects  from a STL mesh file, I have used the
[binvox](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~min/binvox/) rasterizer. Once
the boundary has been obtained, a simple interior filling process is
applied to fill up the objects.
